### 3. [Important] Start Cron

You need to access the endpoint URL.
You will see this message on the page so click "Start?" link ONCE. Do not click it for multiple times. After clicking it once, please reload the page. If the message changed to "Cron status: active", Cron is now turned on.

## How to Use

After you start Cron, it will automatically trigger workflows.

If you want to know a certain query came from Cron or not, you can use an optional input variable "is_cron".
If Cron made that query, is_cron is set to "yes", otherwise is_cron is empty.
You can make a branch with an if block like the workflow below.

## Cron Format

The order is "seconds minutes hours days months weekdays".
At the moment, only wildcards and lists are supported.
For example, "0,15,30,45 * * * * *" will trigger the workflow every thirty seconds; at XX:XX:00, XX:XX:15, XX:XX:30 and XX:XX:45 to be more specific.
